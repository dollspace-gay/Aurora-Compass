AccountPreferences Structure (app_state.rs:59-126)\nCreated a new struct with Optional fields for all overridable preferences:\n- color_mode, language_prefs, show_content_warnings\n- auto_play_gifs, auto_play_videos, reduce_motion\n- font_size, haptic_feedback, sound_effects\n- pinned_feeds, muted_words (account-specific)\n\n### 2. Per-Account Storage (app_state.rs:212)\nAdded to AppPersistedState:\n`account_preferences: HashMap\u003cString, AccountPreferences\u003e`\nKeyed by account DID for isolated per-account state\n\n### 3. Preference Resolution Methods (app_state.rs:273-370)\nImplemented getter methods with automatic fallback:\n- `get_*_for_account(did: Option\u003c\u0026str\u003e)` for each preference\n- Returns account override if set, otherwise returns global\n- Passing None always returns global preference\n\n### 4. Preference Setter Methods (app_state.rs:374-476)\nImplemented setters for per-account overrides:\n- `set_account_*(did, value: Option\u003cT\u003e)` methods\n- Setting to None clears override (uses global)\n- Automatic cleanup of empty preference entries\n\n### 5. Utility Methods\n- `has_account_overrides(did)` - check if account has any overrides\n- `clear_account_preferences(did)` - remove all overrides for account\n- `cleanup_account_prefs_if_empty(did)` - automatic cleanup\n\n## Testing\n- ✅ **16 new unit tests** added\n- ✅ **23 total app_state tests** passing\n- ✅ **78 workspace tests** passing\n- ✅ Full workspace builds successfully\n- ✅ Tested resolution with/without overrides\n- ✅ Tested serialization/deserialization\n- ✅ Tested automatic cleanup\n- ✅ Tested multiple accounts with different preferences\n\n## Use Cases Supported\n- ✅ Different theme per account (work = light, personal = dark)\n- ✅ Different language per account\n- ✅ Different content filters per account\n- ✅ Account-specific pinned feeds\n- ✅ Account-specific muted words\n- ✅ Any preference can be overridden per-account\n\n## Example Usage\n```rust\nlet mut state = AppPersistedState::default();\n\n// Set global preferences\nstate.color_mode = ColorMode::Light;\nstate.font_size = 1.0;\n\n// Override for work account\nstate.set_account_color_mode(\"did:plc:work\", Some(ColorMode::Dark));\nstate.set_account_font_size(\"did:plc:work\", Some(1.2));\n\n// Resolution with fallback\nassert_eq!(state.get_color_mode_for_account(Some(\"did:plc:work\")), ColorMode::Dark);\nassert_eq!(state.get_color_mode_for_account(Some(\"did:plc:personal\")), ColorMode::Light);\nassert_eq!(state.get_color_mode_for_account(None), ColorMode::Light);\n\n// Clear override\nstate.set_account_color_mode(\"did:plc:work\", None);\n// Now uses global again\n```\n\nNext: UI layer to expose per-account preferences in Settings screen.","created_at":"2025-11-19T03:08:58Z"}]}

Each account can now configure their own AppView endpoint independently.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 1. Data Model (atproto-client/src/session/mod.rs)\n- Added `app_view_url: Option\u003cString\u003e` field to SessionAccount struct\n- Updated all constructors and serialization\n- Defaults to None (uses service URL)\n\n### 2. Session Management (atproto-client/src/session/manager.rs)\n- Modified `switch_account()` to configure BskyAgent with account's AppView URL\n- Added `set_account_app_view(did, url)` method to update AppView for an account\n- Added `get_account_app_view(did)` method to retrieve current AppView setting\n- Agent automatically recreates when AppView is changed for current account\n\n### 3. Auth Service Integration (app-core/src/auth.rs)\n- Added `set_app_view_url(did, url)` method (wrapper around SessionManager)\n- Added `get_app_view_url(did)` method (wrapper around SessionManager)\n- Provides high-level API for UI layer\n\n## Testing\n- ✅ 20 new unit tests added\n- ✅ All 39 session tests passing\n- ✅ All 64 storage tests passing\n- ✅ Full workspace builds successfully\n- ✅ Tested serialization with/without AppView URL\n- ✅ Tested persistence across restarts\n- ✅ Tested account switching with custom AppView\n- ✅ Tested error handling for nonexistent accounts\n\n## Key Features\n- Per-user AppView configuration (not global)\n- Persisted to disk (survives app restarts)\n- Backward compatible (None = use service URL)\n- Agent recreation when AppView changes for active account\n- Full error handling and validation\n\n## Example Usage\n```rust\n// Set custom AppView for an account\nauth_service.set_app_view_url(\"did:plc:abc123\", Some(\"https://api.bsky.app\".to_string())).await?;\n\n// Get current AppView\nlet app_view = auth_service.get_app_view_url(\"did:plc:abc123\").await;\n\n// Clear custom AppView (revert to service URL)\nauth_service.set_app_view_url(\"did:plc:abc123\", None).await?;\n```\n\nNext: UI layer to expose this functionality in Settings screen.","created_at":"2025-11-19T00:23:05Z"}]}
